/* I decided to make the particle effect system revolve around this abstract class since it seemed to be the most simple method of implementing  
 * a 'Particle System Library' that could host different kinds of particle effects.
 * The idea is that any particle system that has some special code to function would implement this class so that it could still be added in the library.
 * I didn't want there to be a lot of separate particle effect classes and instead thought it would be neater if they all could exist in the same space.

// --- IMPORTANT ---
// To create a new type of particle effect, make a new C# code that inherits from ParticleEffect.
// Note that particle effects with their particle system's "play on awake" OR "looping" set to true will not be automatically managed by the system.
// This system is not intended for particle systems with "play on awake" set to true

/// Represents a particle system on a game object.
